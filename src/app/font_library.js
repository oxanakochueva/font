In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.</p><p>In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.</p><p>When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.</p><p>The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz. Learn more at  <a href='www.latofonts.com'</a></p>",

          "<p>People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.</p><p>Motivated by my love for the pixel I designed Bitter. A 'contemporary' slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.</p><p>Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is thicker than a normal ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.</p><p>Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.</p>",

Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text.</p><p>The Devanagari and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Devanagari headline falls just below the Latin capital-height. In other words, the Devanagari base characters are 94% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Devanagari script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Hind’s Devanagari vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary.</p><p>Each font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts. These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. The Latin component’s character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.</p><p>Manushi Parikh designed Hind for the Indian Type Foundry, who first published the fonts in 2014.</p><p>The Hind project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

There are a great many “programmer fonts,” designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.</p><p>Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck.</p><p>The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge. The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.</p><p>To contribute, see  <a href = 'github.com/googlefonts/inconsolata'> </a>.</p>",
